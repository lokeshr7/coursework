				    <p>
					To help the learners understand the the basic principles of Engineering Drawing and to develop
					the ability to visualize and draw an object with physical and dimensional configuration.

				    UNIT – I
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					<strong>Basics of engineering drawing and curves:</strong> AImportance of drawing 
					in engineering applications – Use of drafting instruments – BIS
					specifications – lettering and dimensioning – Geometric construction – Conic sections: ellipse,
					parabola and hyperbola. Cycloids-epicycloids and hypocycloid. Involutes- triangle, square and
					circle.
					</p>

					<h4>
				    UNIT – II
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Projection of points, lines and solids:</strong> General principles of orthographic 
					projections – First angle projection – projection of points
					located in all quadrants – projection of straight lines located in the first quadrant: determination
					of true lengths and true inclinations – Projections of Solids-prisms, pyramids, cylinders and
					cones (Truncated solids not included) – change of position method and change of reference line
					method.

					<p>
					<strong>Section of solids and development of lateral surfaces:</strong> Section of solids - 
					true shape of sections – development of lateral surfaces of solids - prisms,
					pyramids, cylinders and cones.
