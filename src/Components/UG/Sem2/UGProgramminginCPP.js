				    OBJECTIVE
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					The course has been developed to introduce object oriented concepts. Gradually they will be exposed
					to core concepts like class, object, inheritance, overloading etc, and they can apply it to any real
					world scenario.

					<strong>Introduction:</strong> Fundamentals of object oriented programming 
					– procedure oriented programming
					Vs. object oriented programming (OOP), 
					Object oriented programming concepts – Classes,
					reusability, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, 
					dynamic binding, message passing.
					<strong> C++ Programming Basics:</strong> Output Using cout, directives, 
					input with cin, type bool, setw Manipulator, type Conversions.
					<strong> Functions:</strong> returning values from functions, reference arguments, 
					overloaded function, inline function, default arguments, returning by reference.

					<strong>Object And Classes:</strong> Implementation of Class in C++, 
					C++ Objects Vs Physical Object, C++ Object as Data Types, Constructor, 
					Object As Function Arguments, the Default Copy
					Constructor, returning Object From Function, Structures And Classes, Classes Objects And
					Memory Static Class Data, Const Data and Classes.
					<strong> Arrays and String Arrays Fundamentals:</strong> Arrays as Class Member Data, Arrays of Object,
					String, the standard C++ String Class. <strong>Operator Overloading:</strong> Overloading Unary Operators,
