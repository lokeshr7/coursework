				    <h4>
				    OBJECTIVE
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					Learners can derive a basic knowledge of 
					mechanical engineering principles to 
					realize physical systems, components and 
					processes in both thermal and mechanical systems.
					</p>

				    <h4>
				    UNIT – I
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					<strong>Energy Resources and Power Plants: </strong> 
					Conventional and non-conventional energy resources 
					– applications, power plants – steam,
					hydel, nuclear, gas turbine, combined cycles. 
					Steam boilers – modern high pressure boilers
					(Babcock & Wilcox boiler, La-MONT boiler and 
					Benson boiler only). Steam turbines – types,
					operating principle (of Simple impulse, Reaction, 
					Velocity compounding, Pressure compounding
					and Pressure – velocity compounding).
					</p>

					<h4>
				    UNIT – II
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Refrigeration, Air-conditioning & I.C. Engines: </strong>
					Refrigeration and Air-conditioning – principles 
					of operation of refrigerator (Vapour compression
					system only) and air-conditioner (Window and 
					Central air conditioning systems). I.C. Engines –
					types – working principles of 2-stroke (Petrol engine) 
					and 4-stroke engines (Petrol and Diesel
					engine) – fuel injection systems (Fuel Injection Pump 
					and Injector for Diesel engine & MPFI for
					Petrol engine) – ignition systems (Battery and 
					Magneto ignition system) – cooling and
					lubrication systems.
					</p>

					<h4>
				    UNIT - III
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Manufacturing Technology (Machining & Forming): </strong>
					Machining – operations in lathe (turning, facing, 
					knurling, forming, drilling, boring, reaming,
					counter boring, chamfering and grooving 
					operations only), drilling (drilling, reaming, boring,
					counter boring, counter sinking, spot facing and 
					tapping operations only) and shaping (shaping
					horizontal surface, shaping vertical surface, 
					shaping angular surface, shaping slots, grooves &
					keyways and shaping irregular surface operations 
					only), introduction to CNC machining.
					Forming – principles of forging – rolling – 
					extrusion – sheet metal forming (blanking, punching &
					bending) – drawing (Wire drawing only).
					</p>

					<h4>
				    UNIT - IV
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Manufacturing Technology (Foundry & Welding): </strong> 
					Foundry process – pattern making (single piece, 
					split pieces and core) – casting (preparation of
					green sand mould, pouring of molten metal, 
					mould shake out and cleaning). Welding –
					principles – types (Manual Metal Arc Welding 
					and Oxy-acetylene gas welding).
