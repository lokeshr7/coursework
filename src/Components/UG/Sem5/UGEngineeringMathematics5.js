				    OBJECTIVE
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					This course provides various numerical methods of solving ordinary and partial differential
					Equations, their advantages and limitations in terms of quick and time consuming computations. 
					It also deals probability distributions and Random Processes and a
					few special classes of random processes up to renewal process.
