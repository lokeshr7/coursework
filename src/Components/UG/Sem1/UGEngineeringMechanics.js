				    OBJECTIVE
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					The objective of this fundamental course in 
					mechanics is to enhance the analytical and logical
					problem solving skills of the student. The basic 
					concepts dealt in this course form the
					cornerstone of advanced topics such as solid 
					mechanics, structural mechanics, fluid mechanics,
					aero-mechanics, bio-mechanics, machine design 
					and electrical/robotics devices.

				    UNIT – I
				    </h4>
				    <p>
					<strong>Equilibrium of Particles: </strong> 
					Frames of reference - Force Systems - 
					Resolution and addition of forces, 
					resultant of several concurrent forces, Forces in 3D, 
					Equations of equilibrium of particle in 2D and 3D - 
					Lame’s theorem.
					</p>

					<h4>
				    UNIT – II
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies: </strong>
					Moment of a force about a point – moments 
					and couples – Varignon’s theorem - equivalent
					force systems-resultant of non-concurrent force 
					systems – parallel forces. Equations of equilibrium 
					of rigid bodies in 2D and 3D. 
					<strong> Applications: </strong>
					Beams – types of supports, loads and reactions. 
					Concept of internal forces. Analysis of pin jointed 
					trusses – Method of sections and joints.

					<h4>
				    UNIT - III
				    </h4>
					<p>
					<strong>Friction: </strong> 
					Laws of friction – simple contact friction - cone of friction 
					– belt friction – wedge friction – screw jack. 
					<strong> Properties of areas: </strong>
					Centroid of line, area and volume – 
					Composite areas – hollow sections –
					Center of gravity of regular solids – cone – 
					hemisphere. Second moment of areas – Parallel axis
					theorem – perpendicular axis theorem. Method 
					of integration for M.I of areas – triangle, circle,
					semi circle, quadrant of a circle. Composite 
					sections – Tee section, I section, Z section.

					<strong>Dynamics of Particles: </strong> 
					Displacement, velocity and acceleration and 
					their relationship – rectilinear and Curvilinear
					motion - rectangular components, Tangent 
					and normal acceleration. Motion in a circular path.
					Newton’s laws – Applications. Work energy 
					principle- impulse and momentum principle. Applications.
